/// <summary>
/// Helper to apply the color transition of a button to its graphic children.
/// Usually UI.Button copies its color states only to one target, i.e. the buttons image,
/// but often child elements like text or icons should be colorized too, which is done by this script.
/// 
/// Usage: 
/// - Create a button with child elements, i.e. text and image.
/// - Add GUICopyButtonTint to both children.
///
/// Versions: 
/// - 01 Jan 2016: Replaced GetComponent<CanvasRenderer>() with targetGraphic.canvasRenderer
